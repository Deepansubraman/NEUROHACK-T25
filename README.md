# Hand signs (ASL) to Text and Speech Conversion with Auto-Correction


This project aims to bridge communication gaps by converting American Sign Language (ASL) hand signs into text and speech. Leveraging machine learning and computer vision, the system accurately transcribes ASL signs into text and uses text-to-speech functionality to read the text aloud. A unique auto-correction feature has been added to automatically fix common transcription mistakes, ensuring grammatically correct and natural communication.

Features
ASL to Text Conversion: Converts ASL hand signs into accurate text.

Text-to-Speech: The transcribed text is read aloud, enabling real-time communication.

Auto-Correction (New Feature): Previously, the system lacked an auto-correction feature. Now, the system automatically corrects common grammatical errors in the transcribed text (e.g., fixing "what you doing" to "what are you doing"), improving accuracy and natural flow of communication.
