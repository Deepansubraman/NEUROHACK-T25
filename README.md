# Hand signs (ASL) to Text and Speech Conversion with Auto-Correction


This project aims to bridge communication gaps by converting American Sign Language (ASL) hand signs into text and speech. Leveraging machine learning and computer vision, the system accurately transcribes ASL signs into text and uses text-to-speech functionality to read the text aloud. A unique auto-correction feature automatically fixes common transcription mistakes to ensure grammatically correct and natural communication.
